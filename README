This is a set of utility functions for the perl programming language that I
find myself rewriting frequently. Normally, putting functions into a module
introduces a dependency on that module which can be a hassle in some
situations. This is a "smart" module which is capable of replacing the
"use Dean::Util..." line with the code for the requested functions. Thus,
machines that have Dean::Util installed can use it as a module, but when
requested, a (Dean::Util) dependency-free version of the file may be made.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build MANIFEST
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install


DEPENDENCIES

Some of the functions in this module require other modules and libraries.
In order to use all of the included functions, you should install the
following modules. However, most functions will work without them.

    Term::ReadKey
    XML::LibXML       # Only for the libxml specific functions
    LWP::Simple       # Not used often


DEBIAN

This is a complete list of debian packages that provide the above modules:

    libterm-readkey-perl
    libxml-libxml-perl
    libwww-perl             # for LWP::Simple
